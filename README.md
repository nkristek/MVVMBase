This is a very lightweight library containing base classes for implementing .NET applications using the MVVM architecture.
It is fully unit tested and platform independent.

For an example project, please visit my other project [Stein](https://github.com/nkristek/Stein), where it is used in a WPF environment.

## Features

This library contains base implementations of:
- `INotifyPropertyChanging` and `INotifyPropertyChanged`
- `INotifyDataErrorInfo`
- `ICommand` and asynchronous `IAsyncCommand`

Additionally, there are other base classes that provide additional features, for example `TreeViewModel` implements an `IsChecked` property that automatically updates its parent and children.

For more information, please visit the [documentation](https://github.com/nkristek/Smaragd/wiki).

## Installation

The recommended way to use this library is via [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NKristek.Smaragd/).

Currently supported frameworks:
- .NET Standard 2.0 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher

## Why another MVVM library?

This library originated in my other project [Stein](https://github.com/nkristek/Stein) and was subsequently moved to its own repository and nuget package. The goal is to provide a great yet minimal foundation which also promotes a good code style. Nearly everything is marked virtual ([except events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hy3sefw3.aspx)) so you can customize it to fit your needs.

And of course, this library is [ðŸš€blazing fastðŸš€](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/974390255393505280).
